# PAIN - CITY
A really small &amp; simple text-adventure I wrote way back when I was something between 13 and 15 years old.

The in-game language is German, partially with regional dialect and surely with lots of grammar and spelling mistakes ;-)

The original code I wrote and shared with my friends once upon a time had been written in (Q)BASIC, so that won't run on modern 64-bit operating systems anymore.
I'll try to migrate it to something compilable with FreeBasic to be able to run it on Windows 10 or some other more modern 64-bit OS.
