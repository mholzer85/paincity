# PAIN - CITY
A really small &amp; simple text-adventure I wrote way back when I was something between 13 and 15 years old.

The in-game language is German, partially with regional dialect and surely with lots of grammar and spelling mistakes ;-)
It's written in BASIC and this is the original code I wrote and shared with my friends once upon a time.
